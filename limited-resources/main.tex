\title{Lecture Note on Limited Resources}
\author{Jeehoon Kang}
\maketitle

Until the midterm exam, we had mostly focused on the pure algorithms.  From now on, we will also
focus on the limited resources such as processors, cache, memory, etc.


\section{Brent's Theorem}

Let's first consider processors.  Fortunately, parallel algorithms enjoy the following property:

\begin{theorem}[Brent]
  Let $W$ and $S$ be the work and span of an algorithm.  Given $P$ processors, it is possible to
  execute the algorithm with the time complexity $T = O \Big( \dfrac{W}{P} + S \Big)$.
\end{theorem}

Brent's algorithm basically says, given $P$ processors and an algorithm with work $W$ and span $S$,
there exists a \textbf{scheduler} that assigns the jobs to the $P$ processors with time complexity
$O((W/P) + S)$.  For the proof of Brent's theorem, we refer the reader to a Wikipedia page:
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms}.


\paragraph{Example: Matrix Multiplication}

Multiplying two matrices of size $n \times n$ costs $O(n^3)$ work and $O(lg~n)$ span.  Given varying
number of processors, you can execute the algorithm with the time complexity as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c | c }
 \# of processors & time complexity \\
  \hline
 $O(1)$ & $O(n^3)$ \\
 $O(n)$ & $O(n^2)$ \\
 $O(n^2)$ & $O(n)$ \\
 $O(n^3 / (lg~n))$ & $O(lg~n)$ \\
 $O(n^3)$ & $O(lg~n)$ \\
 $O(\infty)$ & $O(lg~n)$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Example: Systolic Array}

\paragraph{Example}

These videos are excellent examples of systolic array:
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzVyQzv8FG8} \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK5fjuEFJu0}
Watching these videos, you will quite get the idea of systolic array.

FYI, ``systolic'' means ``relating to the phase of the heartbeat when the heart muscle contracts and
pumps blood from the chambers into the arteries.''
(\url{https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/systolic}).


\paragraph{Algorithm}

Here is the systolic array algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Systolic Array}\label{systolic}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Systolic}{$W,X$} \Comment{Systolic array algorithm}
    \State $I_0 = [(i,j) \mapsto 0]$ \Comment{Systolic input from $X$}
    \State $A_0 = [(i,j) \mapsto 0]$ \Comment{Accumulator}
    \State $O_0 = [(i,j) \mapsto 0]$ \Comment{Output ($W \times X$)}
    \State $\Call{SystolicInner}{W,X,0,I_0,A_0,O_0}$
    \EndProcedure
    \Statex
    \Procedure{SystolicInner}{$W,X,k,I,A,O$} \Comment{A helper function}
    \If{$k = 3n-1$}
    \State \textbf{return} $O$
    \EndIf
    \State $I' = [(i,j) \mapsto (i=0)~?~X(k-j,j)~:~I(i-1,j)]$
    \State $A' = [(i,j) \mapsto ((j=0)~?~0~:~A(i,j-1)) + (W(i,j) \times I'(i,j)))]$
    \State $O' = O[\forall i.~(i,k-n-i) \mapsto A(i,n-1)]$
    \State $\Call{SystolicInner}{W,X,k+1,I',A',O'}$
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

An invocation to \textsc{SystolicInner} costs $O(n^2)$ work and $O(1)$ span.  Thus the total cost of
\textsc{Systolic} is $O(n^3)$ work and $O(n)$ span.


\paragraph{Discussion}

Systolic array is a way of realizing the matrix multiplication algorithm with $n^2$ processors and
$O(n)$ time complexity, by $(i)$ placing the $n^2$ processors in square ($n \times n$), and $(ii)$
assigning the computation of $I(i,j)$, $A(i,j)$, and $O(i,j)$ to the $(i,j)$-th processor.  In other
words, you may think of systolic array as the combination of $(i)$ the matrix multiplication
algorithm and $(ii)$ a scheduling strategy for $n^2$ processors.

Then what's the difference between the systolic array and the general matrix multiplication
algorithm with the Brent's scheduler?  Notice that systolic array exhibits excellent spatial
locality: the computation within a processor requires only those values in the same or adjacent
processor.  Systolic array is designed so as to exploit this spatial locality, which greatly
improves the throughput in the real-world, resource-limited computers.  In contrast, Brent's theorem
says nothing about locality.

Systolic array is widely deployed in high-performance computer architecture.  For example, Google's
TPU has a systolic array of ${256}^2$ processors, which is able to multiply two matrices of size
$256 \times 256$ within $256 \times 3$ cycles (see \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04760.pdf} for
more details).
